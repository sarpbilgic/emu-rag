Those enrolled in programs where the education is in English and who do not fulfill the English Proficiency requirements should take the English Proficiency test administered by the English Preparatory School. A preparation program for undergraduate studies is organised for those who become successful from this exam. Those who fail the English Proficiency Test follow the English Preparatory School program. Students who follow the English Preparatory School program are admitted to the preparatory program for undergraduate studies after having fulfilled the provisions of the Education, Examinations and Success By-law. (b) Within the framework of Preparation Program for Undergraduate Studies, every department prepares a package program which corresponds to 70±2% of the total credit load of the first four semesters of the department’s undergraduate program. This package program is approved by the Senate upon the recommendation of the Faculty/School Board and announced by the Rector’s Office. (c) No special classes are opened for those who take the preparation program for undergraduate studies. These students attend courses with current students of the department in classes that already exist."
